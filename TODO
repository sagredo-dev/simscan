Todo List - Friz

Logging of message-id along with other information currently logged

Ensure each exit point has an appropriate message in the log

Another request: parameters for calling spamd could be placed in a
environment variable (or inside simcontrol). Actually we need to
recompile if there is any change.

enable/disable spam-auth-user via simcontrol?

Bogofilter support

CRM114 support

Todo List - Previous

revamp "on/off" features for more granularity

investigate ways of parsing headers from spamassassin for spamassassin 3.0

change ifdef DEBUG to environment variable check (should be simple, have an
	env check set a global variable and have if statements before debug
	output.  Also, set it up so debugging can be completely disabled
	at compile time.. --disable-debug

capture clamdscan output and parse out the virus for the log files

perhaps add in support for the custom error code patch (low priority) so we
	can send back why the message was rejected to the client
	ie, virus, spam, etc..
	this would be an option that would have to be compiled in as an option
	on the ./configure script, of course
	
Install should create quarantine directory with proper permissions
